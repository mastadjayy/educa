Structure of the course catalog:

    Course 1
        Module 1
            Content 1 (image)
            Content 2 (text)
        Module 2
            Content 3 (image)
            Content 4 (file)
            Content 5 (video)
            ...

These are the initial Subject, Course, and Module models. The Course model fields
are as follows:
• owner: The instructor who created this course.
• subject: The subject that this course belongs to. It is a ForeignKey field that
points to the Subject model.
• title: The title of the course.
• slug: The slug of the course. This will be used in URLs later.
• overview: A TextField column to store an overview of the course.
• created: The date and time when the course was created. It will be
automatically set by Django when creating new objects because of auto_now_
add=True.
Each course is divided into several modules. Therefore, the Module model contains
a ForeignKey field that points to the Course model.
